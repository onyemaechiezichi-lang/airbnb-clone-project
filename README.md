## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
This feature enables users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. It ensures that each user can securely access their data and settings.

### Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete their property listings through this feature. This allows for efficient management of available accommodations.

### Booking System
This system enables users to search for properties, select dates, and make reservations. It streamlines the booking process and enhances user experience.

### Review System
Users can leave reviews and ratings for properties they have stayed in. This feature fosters transparency and helps future guests make informed decisions.

### Payment Processing
This feature handles all payment transactions securely. It ensures that users can pay for bookings safely, protecting sensitive financial information.

## API Security

### Authentication
We will implement token-based authentication using JWT to verify user identities. This ensures that only authorized users can access certain endpoints.

### Authorization
Authorization checks will be enforced to restrict access to resources based on user roles. This is crucial for protecting sensitive actions and data.

### Rate Limiting
Rate limiting will be implemented to prevent abuse of the API. This protects the application from potential denial-of-service attacks and ensures fair usage.

### Importance of Security
Securing the APIs is vital to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and secure payment information. This builds trust with users and safeguards the integrity of the platform.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are practices that automate the process of code integration and deployment. CI/CD pipelines help ensure that code changes are automatically tested and deployed, reducing errors and speeding up development.

### Importance for the Project
Implementing CI/CD pipelines is essential for maintaining code quality and facilitating quick iterations. It allows the team to deploy updates more frequently and reliably.

### Tools
We could utilize tools like GitHub Actions for automating workflows and Docker for containerization. These tools simplify the development process and enhance collaboration among team members.
